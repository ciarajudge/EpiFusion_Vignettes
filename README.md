# EpiFusion Framework Software Vignettes

This repository holds the code and data used for a series of vignettes on using the EpiFusion Analysis Framework to analyse some simulated outbreak datasets. To fully recreate the workflow, you can use the `full_manuscript.Rmd` file to follow each step.

By cloning this repository, extra manuscript assets (e.g. diagrams created outside R) are also made available to compile the manuscript and supplementary information.
